TODO:
- be able to freedraw on frames
- support adding text to frames?
- export audio with frames (can audio be editable to?)

'fun' issues:
- how to handle large mp4s with a lot of frames? (like > 100)
  only show a certain number of frames at a time? how to keep track of edits?
  should we just re-read the file whenever we need to look at a new subset of frames?
  have something akin to pagination?

- currently I have a constraint on the canvas dimensions for the canvas elements to display frames
  but when we save edits, the new mp4 will be based on the canvas dimensions
  can we get it so that the saved mp4 will have the same dimensions as the source file?
  will we need to keep track of edits and re-read back samples to reapply edits on a canvas with original dimensions?
  can we also get it so that the resolution of frames remains the same for saved mp4s as the source?
