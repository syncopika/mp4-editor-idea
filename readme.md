# mp4 editor idea    
    
exploring the WebCodecs API with mp4 files :D. right now it can only extract frames and some very basic editing (a couple image filters, ability to delete frames).    
    
this app is likely most useful for only small mp4 files (e.g. with durations of a few seconds/less than a minute).
