#mp4 editor idea    
    
exploring the WebCodecs API with mp4 files :D. right now it can only extract and show frames but hopefully more to come.   
    
much thanks to the contributors to mp4box.js, the WebCodecs demos/API and [josephrocca](https://github.com/josephrocca/getVideoFrames.js/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file).
