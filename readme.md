# mp4 editor idea    
    
exploring the WebCodecs API with mp4 files :D. right now it can only extract frames and some very basic editing (a couple image filters, ability to delete frames). you can also seek to a certain time range and gather frames from that range.    
    
this app is currently likely most useful for only small mp4 files (e.g. with durations of a few seconds to maybe a couple minutes).
